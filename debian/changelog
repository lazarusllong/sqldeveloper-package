sqldeveloper-package (0.5.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Since SQL Developer v4.1, Oracle has started to include i386 and amd64
    shared libraries in NetBeans Platform modules. Due to this, converted
    make-sqldeveloper-package to both generate multiple packages and to be
    Multi-Arch compatible:
    - Added Multi-Arch dependencies
    - Added cross-packaging functionality
    - Rewrote a large portion of make-sqldeveloper-package to deal with the
      additional logic
    - Rearranged the debian/* files to support multiple packages
    - Generated packages recommend each other (libraries and SQL Developer)
    - Added a new command line option "-s|--skip-libraries" to skip building
      the shared libraries package(s)
  * Multiple versions can now coexist, "sqldeveloper.[upstream version]" will
    invoke a specific version of Oracle SQL Developer while "sqldeveloper"
    takes advantage of Debian's alternatives system and, when left in auto
    mode, will always invoke the highest version installed
  * Exposed Oracle CLI for SQL Developer, a non-gui interface for scripting or
    headless control of Oracle SQL Developer. Following the multiple versions
    coexistence concept, "sdcli.[upstream version]" and "sdcli" will behave as
    described above
  * Since SQL Developer v4.2, Oracle started to bundle Oracle SQL Developer
    Command-Line (SQLcl) with Oracle SQL Developer. When available, and as an
    alternative to the standalone package (see "sqlcl-package"),
    make-sqldeveloper-package will expose it. Since there is a name conflict
    with content of package "parallel", the upstream binary "sql" will be
    renamed, and following the above multiple versions coexistence concept,
    "sql.[upstream version].bundled" will invoke a specific SQLcl version
    while "sqlcl.bundled" takes advantage of Debian's alternatives system and,
    when left in auto mode, will always invoke the highest bundled version
    installed, and "sqlcl" will invoke the highest version installed (either
    standalone or bundled, in this order)
  * Added a new command line option "-x|--extract-only" to prepare a build
    tree without building package(s) (this option implies "-k|--keep-dir")
  * Added descriptive header, detailed progress output and stdout/stderr
    selection according to the type of message
  * Added a new command line option "-q|--quiet" to suppress normal output
  * Fixed the long time broken command line option "-i|--install" which was
    not finding the correct package name
  * Synchronized code between sqldeveloper-package and sqlcl-package
  * Updated sqldeveloper package description to reflect Oracle's site
  * Fixed some small typos in the machine readable copyright file "License:"
    section creation
  * Fixed lintian warnings and errors:
    - possible-documentation-but-no-doc-base-registration
    - desktop-entry-lacks-keywords-entry
  * Silenced all lintian warnings and errors that are upstream originated and
    impossible to fix
  * Tested against v4.x and v17.x release families of SQL Developer
  * Bumped version to reflect functionality
