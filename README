The Debian Package sqldeveloper-package
---------------------------------------

In order to run Oracle SQL Developer you'll need a full working JDK. The
versions that are compatible with SQL Developer are any JDK 1.5.0_06 or above
or JDK 1.6.0_03 or above for SQL Developer versions up to 1.5.5. SQL Developer
versions from 2.1 to 3.1 are compatible with JDK 1.6.0_11 or above and SQL
Developer version 3.2 is compatible with JDK 1.6.0_04 or above.

Note that Oracle SQL Developer is not compatible with JDK 1.7 (JDK7.0).

The free JDKs included in Debian, default-jdk and openjdk-6-jdk are not fully
compatible: the first isn't recognized as a SDK, and the second makes SQL
Developer generate a wrong version warning whenever it starts.

There are a couple of ways to obtain a compatible JDK:

- download and run the installer for the version you wish to install from
  Oracle <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/>
- install java-package (contrib/misc) and generate a Debian package from the
  above installer

After installing a compatible JDK simply launch SQL Developer through the
graphical interface or by invoking /usr/bin/sqldeveloper and supply the path
where the JDK was installed when prompted.
