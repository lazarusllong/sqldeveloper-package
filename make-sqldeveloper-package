Description: Oracle SQL Developer
 Oracle SQL Developer is a free graphical tool that enhances productivity and
 simplifies database development tasks.  With SQL Developer, you can browse
 database objects, run SQL statements and SQL scripts, and edit and debug
 PL/SQL statements.  You can also run any number of provided reports, as well
 as create and save your own.  You can connect to and migrate 3rd party
 databases to an Oracle database.
 .
 Oracle SQL Developer is a Java application and requires a full Java SDK.  The
 minimum JDK you should use is as follows:
 .
 Oracle SQL Developer versions up to 1.5.5 require a minimum JDK of 1.5.0_06.
 If you use JDK1.6 (JDK6.0), the minimum you should use is JDK 1.6.0_03.
 Oracle SQL Developer versions 2.1 up to 3.1 require a minimum JDK of 1.6.0_11.
 Oracle SQL Developer version 3.2 requires a minimum JDK of 1.6.0_04.
 Oracle SQL Developer version 4.0 requires JDK 7 and above.

sqldeveloper for Debian
-----------------------

In order to run Oracle SQL Developer you'll need a full working JDK. The
versions that are compatible with SQL Developer are any JDK 1.5.0_06 or above
or JDK 1.6.0_03 or above for SQL Developer versions up to 1.5.5. SQL Developer
versions from 2.1 to 3.1 are compatible with JDK 1.6.0_11 or above and SQL
Developer version 3.2 is compatible with JDK 1.6.0_04 or above.

Oracle SQL Developer version 4.0 requires JDK 7 and above. Starting with 4.1,
Oracle SQL Developer requires at least JDK 8.

The free JDKs included in Debian, default-jdk and openjdk-6-jdk are not fully
compatible: the first isn't recognized as a SDK, and the second makes SQL
Developer generate a wrong version warning whenever it starts.

There are a couple of ways to obtain a compatible JDK:

- download and run the installer for the version you wish to install from
  Oracle <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/>
- install java-package (contrib/misc) and generate a Debian package from the
  above installer

After installing a compatible JDK simply launch SQL Developer through the
graphical interface or by invoking /usr/bin/sqldeveloper and supply the path
where the JDK was installed when prompted.
